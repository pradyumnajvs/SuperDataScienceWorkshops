You are a Data Analyst working for the Philadelphia police department. The department is trying to find any helpful trends in Crime rates to assist them in planning their work for 2017. You have been supplied a dataset with crimes committed and recorded in the region for the period of 2006-2015. This is a large dataset with over 2,000,000 rows (excel will not be able to handle it).
