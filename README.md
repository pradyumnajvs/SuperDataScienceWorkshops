# SuperDataScienceWorkshops
This repository consists of the code for the Data Challenges (Case Studies or Workshops) posted in SuperDataScience Website. All the case studies which are supposed to be solved in R have been solved. Each folder represents each case study which was posted in the website. Every folder contains the description of the problem in README file, the pdf copy of the question as posted in the website and the code for the data challenge along with the explanation for each step in the code.

The folder names are not in a sequential order as the rest of the challenges apart from the ones in this repository are supposed to be either solved in python or in tableau. The case studies which are supposed to be solved in python will be attempted in R sometime in future.

# NOTE: THE ENTIRE DATASET HAS NOT BEEN ANALYZED. ONLY THE QUESTIONS IN THE PROBLEM STATEMENT HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTED. ONE CAN TRY TO RESOLVE THE ENTIRE DATASET BY THEMSELVES.
